1. Rotating IP addresses is the best way to solve captcha.
  - VPN (worst) - VPN servers are blacklisted by Allegro.
  - Proxy (bad) - Using a large group of IP addresses is a better option.
  - Changing IP (best) - Using a device with a changing IP, such as a phone, is recommended (maximum of 20 captchas per IP).

2. Allegro uses its own captcha system that cannot be solved by industry standard anti-captcha services like 2captcha.

3. Captchas can be solved using algorithms or AI.
  - The difficulty is often related to complex backgrounds.
  - Contrast, color, and shape in the background can make it harder to solve.
  - AI algorithms in big data learning processes might be effective.
